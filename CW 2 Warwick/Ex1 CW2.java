/**
 * Exercise 1 Preamble:
 * This implementation ensures efficient navigation through the maze using both exploration
 * and backtracking strategies. The robot alternates between exploration mode and backtrack mode.
 * Key Design Considerations:
 * - `passageExits` and `nonwallExits` methods accurately count potential moves.
 * - Backtracking is managed through a junction recording system (`RobotData`), enabling systematic exploration.
 * - Repeated code was minimized by modular functions like `corridor` and `junctionOrCrossroads`.
 *
 * Efficiency Considerations:
 * - Efficiency is achieved by switching modes and exploring only necessary paths.
 * - Efficient Backtracking: The robot only records junctions if there are multiple exits and unexplored paths, reducing unnecessary storage.
 * - By distinguishing between walls, passages, and previously visited locations, the robot minimizes re-exploration.
 * - Memory Management: The RobotData class efficiently stores junctions using arrays, limiting memory usage to 10,000 entries.
 * 
 * Design Reasoning : 
 * - Explorer Design: The explorer mode focuses on finding new paths while minimizing repeated visits using passage prioritization.
 * - Backtracker Design: The backtracker ensures systematic path completion by revisiting junctions only when necessary.
 * 
 * Use of RobotData : 
 * - Data Storage: It records junction coordinates, arrival headings, and uses these records during backtracking.
 * - Backtracking Utilization: The robot looks up junction data when backtracking, ensuring it only revisits relevant junctions.
 * 
 * Handling of passageExits and nonwallExits : 
 * passageExits : checks if the robot sees an unexplored passage in methods (junctionOrCrossroads and corridor).
 * nonwallExits: This method counts all directions that are not walls. It helps the robot determine whether 
 * itâ€™s at a dead end, corridor, or junction, ensuring correct path selection.
 *
 * Worst Case Analysis:
 * Yes, the robot Explorer will always find the target if the maze is finite and fully connected. 
 * It systematically explores all paths and backtracks when necessary, ensuring no path is left unchecked.
 * The worst-case scenario occurs in a highly branching and complex maze where every path must
 * be explored before the target is found. In such a scenario:
 * - **Maximum Steps:** If the maze has N squares, the robot could theoretically traverse each
 *   square multiple times due to dead ends and revisits. This results in a worst-case complexity of O.
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * This implementation balances exploration and backtracking, ensuring that the robot navigates the maze
 * efficiently while avoiding unnecessary revisits.
